      <h2>About (?)</h2>
      <p>Esmé Puzio is currently pursuing her B.S. in Computer Science at the 
        University of California, Santa Barbara, with a minor in Art. She's 
        interested in post-internet art, UI/UX design, and the ways in which 
        art and technology can complement and further develop one another. 

        As an artist, she enjoys making colorful and communicative 
        designs, and has been illustrating articles for the Daily Nexus 
        newspaper since 2021.
